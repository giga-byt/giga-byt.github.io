      <h3>Mouse, Ubiquitous</h3>
      <p>
        A mobile mouse that goes where you go: out of sight, out of mind,
        until you need it. Connects a phone via bluetooth to pair with any device
        that has Project Peripheral installed, allowing you the freedom of a mouse,
        anywhere, without a mouse.
